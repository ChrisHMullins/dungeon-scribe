Updates


- When creating a new session it should not start recording automatically. 
- We need to figure out a way that a user can switch sections while a session is being recorded.
- Just like the "live transcription" checkbox, let's add one for Auto Detect Entities. 
- When a session ends, all the live transcription stuff goes away. I think we should be able to view that, with all the labels etc later. 
- I think we should make each session item in the sessions view clickable and go to a session detail page where we can see: multiple transcripts, including the live one, and any versions that get re-transcribed, and all the profiles for that transcript.
-the STT didn't do a great job. It would be good if I could edit the slices by hand. we could have a play button next to each timestamp and I could hear what was said and make some changes by hand. This should be able to be done when viewing a transcript after recording.
