the app should be organized this way:


Top level is: Campaign.
Campaigns have Sessions, Profiles
Sessions have Images and Transcripts.
Profiles have Images and Details


The way this app will be used is on a computer in the room and as people talk, the app will parse in real time. (We shouldn't have a transcribe button- but a "new take" button could create a new version the user can view. )

The main thing is that as the game goes on, images are created and displayed so that people playing the game can see them.

- example: fighnting goblins might show goblins or might show fighting.  
- example: getting treasure might show images of the treasure. 
- example: a character might get described and a picture is made. This picture gets associated with a profile and that picutre might be used again instead of having to make a new one.
